## <font color="green"> This is a solar dashboard to demonstrate solar radiation in Portland for each day of the year </font>

I extracted this data from NREL's National Solar Radiation Database. The idea is to simply use the Panel class and look at the total solar radiation by day of the year. 
The data is broken down by month, and then day to get the total irradiation. Here is what was set up with the data:

* There are fields in the dataset for direct radiation and indirect (DNI vs DHI).
* There are daily sums and means for all data.
* Finally there are scrolers set up so that you can select a month and then day of the month to see all of the summed data, and then a datapoint that shows the mean for that day.
